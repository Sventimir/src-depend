Src-depend is an open-source application designed to build dependency trees
for applications under development. Specify a source directory of your project
and programming language it's written in and src-depend will sketch a dependency
graph for you, which can be output as png image or pdf or even dot source file.

USAGE:
   depend.py [-h] [-l LANG] [-s SRC_OUT] [-i IMG_OUT] [-d] [-f FORMAT]
                 [-e EXCLUDES [EXCLUDES ...]] [--exclude-regex EXCLUDE-REGEX]
                 [-q]
                 target

positional arguments:
  target                source code directory to analyse

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LANG, --lang LANG  specifies language plugin to be used (defaults to
                        python)
  -o IMG_OUT, --output IMG_OUT
                        output sketched graph to specified file (appends
                        extension automatiaclly). Source will be output to
                        IMG_OUT file.
  -d, --debug           debug mode
  -f FORMAT, --output-format FORMAT
                        specifies output image's format (defaults to .png
  -e EXCLUDES [EXCLUDES ...], --exclude EXCLUDES [EXCLUDES ...]
                        a filename to ommit (multiple names possible)
  --exclude-regex EXCLUDE-REGEX
                        filenames matching specified regex will be ignored
  -q, --quiet           quiet mode

SUPPORTED LANGUAGES:
    * Python
    * Haskell

DEPENDENCIES:
    * python3 interpreter
    * graphviz module for python (may be obtained with pip)

EXTENSIONS:
    For now only two programming languages are supported: Python and Haskell.
    It's easy however to extend the application to other languages by writing
    a plugin. A detailed instruction how to do it may be found in module.py's
    docstrings. Existing plugins may also serve as an example.

    Do not forget to issue a pull request, should you develop a new extension. ;)
    Plugins without proper unit test suite won't be incorporated.
